## ListDesk
ListDesk is (to be) an infinite, free-form canvas for organizing your life with movable to-do lists. Drag, drop, zoom, and arrange tasks anywhere. No strict layouts, just an open desk where you can think visually.
> [!note]
> Currently, you can do all of the above except zoom and the desk isn't infinite yet.

## ❓ How do I use this?

Alternatively, you can follow the installation instructions below to run ListDesk locally.
