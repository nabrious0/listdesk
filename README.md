## ListDesk
ListDesk is (to be) an infinite, free-form canvas for organizing your life with movable to-do lists. Drag, drop, zoom, and arrange tasks anywhere. No strict layouts, just an open desk where you can think visually.
> [!note]
> Currently, you can do all of the above except zoom and the desk isn't infinite yet.

## ❓ How do I use this?

You have two options: either use the hosted instance at [https://listdesk.nabrious.workers.dev/](https://listdesk.nabrious.workers.dev/), which is good for testing the app but its reliability isn't guaranteed, as it may go down if overloaded.  

Alternatively, you can follow the installation instructions below to run ListDesk locally.

### Installation Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/nabrious0/listdesk.git
cd listdesk
npm install
npm run dev
```
